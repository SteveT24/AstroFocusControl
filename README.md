AstroFocusControl
=================

Arduino based controller for stepper motor focuser.

The hardware ordered for this project is:

- Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino v2.0
- Arduino and Breadboard Baseplate
- Arduino Uno R3
- Stepper Motor with Cable
- jumper cables

Hopefully, this will all be plug & play apart from the software.

Stage 1 will be PC controlled to test it all works.
Stage 2 will include manual controls so it can be used without a PC.

Fingers crossed.
